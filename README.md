Node for Vim
============
Tools to make Vim superb for developing with Node.js.  
It's the Node equivalent of [Rails.vim (vimscript #1567)](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) and [Rake.vim (vimscript #3669)](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rake).

This is just the first release to get the nodes rolling. If you've collected great helpers and shortcuts that help you work with Node, please share them via [email](mailto:andri@dot.ee), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theml) or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/moll/vim-node/issues) so we could incorporate them here, too! Thanks!


Installing
----------
The easiest and most modular way is to download this to `~/.vim/bundle`:
```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle/node
```

Using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/moll/vim-node.git ~/.vim/bundle/node
```

Using Wget:
```
wget https://github.com/moll/vim-node/archive/master.tar.gz -O- | tar -xf- --strip-components 1 -C ~/.vim/bundle/node
```

Then prepend that directory to Vim's `&runtimepath` (or use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)):
```
set runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/node
```


Using
-----
Currently Node for Vim does these things:
- Sets the filetype to JavaScript for files with Node's shebang (`#!`).
- Adds full support for navigating to modules by using `gf` on `require("any-module")`, require("any-module/lib/utils") and so on.
- Adds `.js` to `&suffixesadd` so you could use `gf` on `require("./foo")` to open `foo.js`.
- Adds `.json` to `&suffixesadd` so you could use `gf` on `require("./package") and have it open package.json. Node does this too.

Expect more to come soon and feel free to let me know what you're after right away.
