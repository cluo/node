Tools to make Vim superb for developing with Node.js.
It's the Node equivalent of Rails.vim (vimscript #1567) and Rake.vim (vimscript #3669).

This is just the first release to get the nodes rolling. If you've collected great helpers and shortcuts that help you work with Node, please share them via email (andri@dot.ee), Twitter (https://twitter.com/theml) GitHub issues (https://github.com/moll/vim-node/issues) so we could incorporate them here, too! Thanks!

Tour:
- Use gf on paths or requires to open the same file Node.js would.
- Use gf on require(".") to open ./index.js
- Use gf on require("./dir") to open ./dir/index.js
- Use gf on require("./foo") to open foo.js.
- Use gf on require("./package") and have it open package.json.
- Use gf on require("module") to open the module's main file (parsed for you from package.json).
- Use gf on require("module/lib/utils") and open files inside the module.
- Automatically sets the filetype to JavaScript for files with Node's shebang (#!).
- Use [I etc. to look for a keyword in required files (Sets Vim's &include).
- Use :Nedit to quickly edit any module, file in a module or your project file.
- Use :Nopen to quickly edit any module and lcd to its directory.
- Node.vim itself is tested with a thorough automated integration test suite! No cowboy coding here!

Expect more to come soon and feel free to let me know what you're after!

PS. Node.vim is absolutely intended to work on Windows, but not yet tested there at all. If you could help, try it out and report issues, I'd be grateful!
